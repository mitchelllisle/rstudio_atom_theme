# rstudio_atom_theme
A theme for Rstudio that looks like the default atom theme. To install, navigate to 

```
Applications/RStudio.app
```
and click on 'Show Package Contents'. From there navigate to 

```
/Contents/Resources/www/rstudio
```
and drag and drop the file in this repo without renaming it. It will replace the theme called 'Material'. 

Note: This works for `RStudio Version 1.1.268`. Anything > than `1.1.268` may not work if the stylesheet names change. 
Or any other fundamental changes are made to the styling in RStudio.
